 Program references the coding sequence of Homo sapiens mRNA for hypothetic protein, 
 Alzheimer disease site specific expressed gene, collected from NCBI and finds the percentage of each base in the gene, 
 counts all the dinucleotides, counts of the trinucleotides, the AT content of the gene and 
 finds presence of any 6-nucleotide or longer repeats in order to provide analysis.
 
### Prerequisites/Assumptions

Python 3+ must be installed on the system running the program. 

AD_sequence.fasta and AD_coding.txt files must be in the same directory as the gene_analysis.py program.
